(Pre)Cached Factorial Dictionary.

Used a non-isolated actor function to perform the factorial calculations in parallel, then collected them all up and sequentially added them to the pre-calculated and thus cached Factorial Dictionary.

On a modern machine the dictionary supports over four million look ups per second.
